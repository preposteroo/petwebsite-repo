                           <pre>    Is this your first dog? How exciting! It can be a little daunting when
    you've never had a pet before, there's so many new responsibilities to consider.
    But I swear, it's worth it:D Are you ready to give your new Fur Baby the 
    best life possible?
    
    Not sure what the basic steps are for caring for a dog? Don't worry! The American 
    Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, has you covered. As the
    first humane society to be established in North America, the ASPCA has long been 
    founded on the belief that animals deserve kind and respectful treatment from humans.
    
    If you have any questions about how to feed a dog, how much exercise they need or 
    even which vaccinations are necessary - from puppies to seniors, they have it all.
